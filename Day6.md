# Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)

Generator --> Discriminator

- Generator -> Generates the image (uses back propagation to fix generation to meet the discriminator)
- Discriminator - checks the image and either accepts the image (whether it is from the real image or generator)

# Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

generative model which are particularly effective in generating new data points similar to the training data

Combine principles from auto-encoders and variational interface. Part of Neural Networks

Used in:
- image generation
- data imputation
- anomaly detection
- Dimensionality Reduction


# Auto regressive models

they are used in time series models that predict the future.
